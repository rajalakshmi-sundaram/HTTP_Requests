Below are the steps we need to follow for sending Java HTTP requests using HttpURLConnection class.

Create URL object from the GET/POST URL String.
Call openConnection() method on URL object that returns instance of HttpURLConnection
Set the request method in HttpURLConnection instance, default value is GET.
Call setRequestProperty() method on HttpURLConnection instance to set request header values, such as “User-Agent” and “Accept-Language” etc.
We can call getResponseCode() to get the response HTTP code. This way we know if the request was processed successfully or there was any HTTP error message thrown.
For GET, we can simply use Reader and InputStream to read the response and process it accordingly.
For POST, before we read response we need to get the OutputStream from HttpURLConnection instance and write POST parameters into it.
